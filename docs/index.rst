Data Basin ArcGIS Geoprocessing Tools
=================================================================

These geoprocessing tools were created to help support spatial analysis and other operations in `Data Basin`_.

These tools are intended to be deployed as geoprocessing services on an ArcGIS Server.
However, most of the internal functions only rely on arcpy and access to the input data, and thus could be executed from
other environments.
